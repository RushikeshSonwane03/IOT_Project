# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è IoT-Based System for Monitoring and Optimizing Cyclist Performance

## Overview

This project presents an **IoT-based system** designed to optimize cyclist performance through real-time feedback and data analysis. It employs a **50 kg Load Cell force sensor** attached to the bike‚Äôs pedal and a **Gyroscope sensor** for measuring elevation changes. The system aims to help cyclists improve their performance, reduce the risk of injury, and achieve their fitness goals by providing valuable insights and feedback.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Continuous monitoring of cyclist‚Äôs performance.
- **Force Measurement**: Captures the force exerted by the cyclist during pedaling.
- **Elevation Detection**: Measures terrain inclines and declines.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides immediate feedback to the cyclist.
- **Performance Insights**: Offers personalized suggestions for improvement.

## Motivation

Cycling is a popular fitness activity, and optimizing performance can significantly enhance the cycling experience. Our system leverages IoT technology to provide real-time insights, helping cyclists to make informed decisions and achieve their fitness goals effectively.

## Implementation

1. **Initialization**: Setting up the microcontroller (NodeMCU ESP8266), sensors (MPU6050 gyroscope and load cell), and connections.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Sensors collect data on motion and exertion continuously.
3. **Data Processing**: Data from sensors is processed to extract meaningful information.
4. **Exertion Level Calculation**: Analyzes angular velocity to determine exertion levels.
5. **Weight and BMI Calculation**: Converts force measurements to weight values and calculates BMI.
6. **Data Logging and Visualization**: Processed data is logged and visualized using platforms like ThingSpeak.
